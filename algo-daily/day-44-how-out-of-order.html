    <title>Day 44 How Out of Order</title>
</head>

        /*
        Determine how "out of order" a list is by writing a function that returns the number of inversions in that list. 

        Teo elements of a list, L , L[i] and L[j] from an inversion if L[i] < L[j] but i > j

        For example, the list [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has 10 inversions since every element is out of order. They are the following: (5, 4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1).

The list [2, 1, 4, 3, 5] has two inversions: (2, 1) and (4, 3).

Do this in better than O(N^2).
