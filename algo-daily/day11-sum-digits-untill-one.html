    <title>Sum Digits Until One</title>

        /*
        We're provided a posited integer "num". Can you write a method to repeadtedly add all of its digits untill the result has only one digit?

        for example, if the input was 49, we'd go thru these steps

        4 + 9 = 13

        1 + 3 = 4

        we would then return 4

        expected time complextiy is O(log n)
        expected space complexity is O(1)
        
        another example, if the input was 86

        8 + 6 = 14

        1 + 4 = 5

        step 1  - need to take a number, and split it apart into 2 seperate numbers
        step 2 - add those two numbers
        step 3 - take the result and check if its less then or equal to 9 to return true
        
        */

        // this is the function to split the digits

        function splitdigits(n) {
            return (n + '').split('').map((i) => { return Number(i); })
        }

        let newDigit = splitdigits(94).reduce(getSum, 0);


        function getSum(total, num) {
            return total + Math.round(num);
        }

        console.log(newDigit);

        if (newDigit <= 9) {
            console.log('done')
        } else {
            console.log("not done yet")
            // for this solution I would have to take the whole code block thu thru the whole cycle again - how the heck do I do that. 
        }

        // here a super quick solution using some sort of dark magic lol...like god damn

        var n = 589892928;
        sum = n % 9 || 9;

        console.log(sum);
