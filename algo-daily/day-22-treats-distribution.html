        Say we are given an integer array of an even length, where different numbers in the array represent certain kinds of snacks or treats. Each number maps to, or represents one kind of snack

        so this array would have two snacks

        const snacks = [3,3,2,2]

        We need to distribute these snacks equally in number to a brother and sister duo. Write an algorithm to return the maximum unique kinds of snacks the sister could gain
