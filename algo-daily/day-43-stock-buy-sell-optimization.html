        This is a classic technical interview question that I've seen a number of times in real life interviews. 
        Let's say you're given an array of stock prices, with each element being an integer that represents a price in dollars.

        [ 10, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 ]
        Each index of the array represents a single day, and the the element at that index is the stock price for that given day. This means that the array below represents:

        const prices = [ 10, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 ];
        // Day 0 - a price of `$10`
        // Day 1 - `$7`
        // Day 2 - `$6` (and so on...)

        Given the ability to only buy once and sell once, our goal is to maximize the amount of profit (selling price - purchase price) that we can attain and return that value. Note the only caveat is that that we cannot sell a stock before we buy it, which is important in identifying a solution.


        Can you write a stock optimizer method called stockOptimizer? See the following examples for further clarification:

        stockOptimizer([ 10, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 ])
        // 7
        For the above example, the max profit is made when we buy on day/index 3 (when the price is 2) and sell on day/index 4 (when the price is 9). 
        9 - 2 gives us 7, which is returned by the function. Let's do another example.

        stockOptimizer([9, 8, 6, 5, 3])
        // 0
        From a quick glance, it seems like there's enough price differences to generate a profit. However, notice that the price drops every day, and thus we can't have a profit since we're required to buy before selling.
