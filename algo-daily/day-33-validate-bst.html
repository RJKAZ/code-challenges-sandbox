        Given a binary search tree like the one below, can you write a function that will return true if it is valid

Recall that a BST is valid only given the following conditions:
- The left child subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the parent node's.
- The right child subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node's.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

You can assume that all nodes, including the root, fall under this node definition:

JS
class Node {

    constructor(val) {

        this.value = val;

        this.left = null;

        this.right = null;

    }

}
The method may be called like the following:

JS
root = new Node(5);

root.left = new Node(3);

root.right = new Node(9);



console.log(isValidBST(root));
Constraints
Length of the given tree <= 100000
The nodes in the tree will always contain integer values between -1000000000 and 1000000000
Expected time complexity : O(n)
Expected space complexity : O(logn) or O(d) where d is the depth of the tree
