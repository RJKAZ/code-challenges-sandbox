    <title>Missing Number in Unsorted</title>

        /*
        Assume we are givne an unsorted array of numbers like this
        [2, 5, 1, 4, 9, 6, 3, 7]

        We are told that when this array is sorted, there is a series of n consecutive numbers. You are givne a lower bound and an upperbound for this sequence. 

        There is one consecutive number missing and we need to find it. 

        As an example, look at the below example. We're told that the lower bound is 1 and the upper bound is 9, the numbers that missing in the unsorted series bounded by these two numbers is 8

        const arr = [2,5,1, 4, 9, 6, 3, 7];

        const lowerBound = 1;
        const upperBound = 9;

        missingInUnsorted(arr, lowerBound, upperBound); returns 9

        Heres the challenge, can you find the missing number in O(n) time? And can you do it without sorting.

        function findMissingNumbers(arr) {
            // create sparse array with a 1 at each index equal to the value in the input
            var sparse = arr.reduce((sparse, i) => (sparse[i]=1, sparse), []);
            // create array 0..highest number, and retain only those values for which the sparse array has nothing at that index (and eliminate the 0 value)
            return [...sparse.keys()].filter(i => i && !sparse[i]);
        }

        var someArr = [2, 5, 3, 1, 4 , 7, 10, 15]
        var result = findMissingNumbers(someArr);
        console.log(result);
