        This first challenge is fairly simple in that we will be reverseing a string

        Can you write a function that reverses an inputted string without using the built in Array # reverse method?

        reverseString("jake") should return "ekaj"

        Rule 1 - Cannot use the built in reverse method
        Rule 2 - Ideal solution woul run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity 
    
        */


        function reverseString(str) {
            let stringArray = str.split(""); // creating a variable and setting to the passed in string, but with the split method to split it apart
            let start = 0; // variable for the start set to 0
            let end = str.length - 1; // variable for the end, set to the length of the inputed string -1

            while (start <= end) { // while the start is less then ot equal to the end 
                const temp = stringArray[start]; // variable of temp set to the stringArrays's start
                stringArray[start] = stringArray[end]; // making the start eqaul to the end 
                stringArray[end] = temp; // setting the end equal to the temp which was the start
                start++; // increment start by 1
                end--; // decrement end by 1
            }

            return stringArray.join("");// return that split and reversed string, but joined together. 
        }

        console.log(reverseString("Samantha"));
