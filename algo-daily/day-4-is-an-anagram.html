        /*
        The definition of an Anagram - A word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another. Such as Cinema, into Iceman

        So we are given two strings like "Cinema" and "Iceman" as inputs. Can you write a function that will return true or false depending on whether the string are anagrams of each other? 

        To Solve this problem, first we take the strings and make them lowercase to ensure case sensativitly doesn't become an issue. 

        Then we're gonna do a chain the methods of split, sort and join

        We use Split to split the arrays appart into individual letters, 
        then we use the sort method to sort them in alpabeitcal order
        then we use the join method ot join them back togther. 

        In case of anagrams, split/sort/join would make them equal values. Anything not equal wouldn't be an anagram

        so we just check if a is equal to b

        function isAnagram(str1, str2) {
            let a = str1.toLowerCase();
            let b = str2.toLowerCase();

            a = a.split("").sort().join("");
            b = b.split("").sort().join("");

            return a === b;
        }

        console.log(isAnagram("mary", "Army"));
