        /*
        So this challenge is to write a function that takes in two arrays as inputs and return to us their intersecton. 

        We can call the method "intersection" - the definition of an intersection of two sets (a and b) is the set containing all elements of A that also belong to B\

        so if A is an array of ["green", "orange", "blue", "red"] and B is an array of ["black", "green", "red", "purple"]

        The intersection of A & B would be ['green', 'red']
        
        Note - all elements in the final result should be unique

        const nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1];
        const nums2 = [2, 2];

        intersection(nums1, nums2) = [2]

        expected time complexity shoyld be O(n+m) where n and m are the lengths of the array
        expected space complexity shoyld be O(max(n,m))
        
        */

        function intersection(nums1, nums2) {
            // making a new set based off the nums1 array - sets are an object type that allow you to store unique values - Sets cannot have duplicates, making them ideal for this problem 
            const set = new Set(nums1); // transform the 1st array into a set
            const filteredSet = new Set(nums2.filter((n) => set.has(n))); // then we take the 2nd array and filter it by the elements that appear in the 1st set, and this in itself is wrapped in another set
            return [...filteredSet]; // then we transform it back into an array using the spread operator 
        }

        console.log(intersection([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2]));


        // now this is the ideal solution. There is another solution where you could use 2 loops to interate over the first array and compare to the 2nd array, but a O(n^2) you always want to avoid
        // the ideal way to handle this problm is to trun the arrays in sets.
