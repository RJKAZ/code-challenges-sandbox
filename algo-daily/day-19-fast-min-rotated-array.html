        /*
        We're given an array of integers that looks like the following
        [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
        Lets imagine we're an assembly line as we decided to shift some workers around. 
        Say we take our array, and rotate it at a random pivot so that the section after the pivot comes before.
        Lets put the pivot between 5 and 6

        [6,7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5]

        can you find the smallest element in O(log n) time? Assume that there are no repeat numbers
        so with 
        [4,5,1,2,3] we get 1

                if (numbers[left] < numbers[right]) {
                    return numbers[left];
                }
                let midpoint = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

                if (numbers[midpoint] >= numbers[left]) {
                    left = midpoint + 1;
                } else {
