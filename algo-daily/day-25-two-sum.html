        Given an Array of Integers, return the indices of the two numbers in it that add up to a specific goal number. 
        So lets say our 'goal' number was 10. Our Numbers to sum to it would be 3 and 7
        And we would return an array of indices 1 and 3 respectivly

        let arr = [1,3,6,7,9]

        let goal = 10;
        twoSum(arr, goal);

        [1,3]

        expected complexity will be O(n) for both space and time
