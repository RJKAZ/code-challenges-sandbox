        /*
        Given two strings, one named sub, and the other str, determin is sub is a subsequence of str

        const str = "barbell"
        const sub = "bell"
        isASubsequence(sub, str);
        // this would return true

        so what is a subsequence? You can think of it as a substring, but the letters don't have to be adjacent. 
        It is formed by the base string by deleting some of none of the characters without affecting positions of the other letters. So this allso works

        const str = "chicken"
        const sub = "hen"
        isASubsequence(sub, str);
        // this would also return true
        
        */

        const sub = "ace";
        const str = "abcde";

        const isASubsequence = (sub, str) => { // creating a variable for the function (that will be arrow) that takes in two sub variables 
            let i = 0; // making a variable for i that is set to 0 but will be changed
            let j = 0; // making a variable for j that is set to 0 but will be changed
            while (i < sub.length) { // while loop, while the i is less then the length of the sub variable
                if (j === str.length) { // if the j is equal the str variable
                    return false; // return false
                }
                if (sub[i] === str[j]) { // if sub of i is equal to str of j
                    i++; //increment the i
                }
                j++; // otherwise increment the j
            };
            return true; // return true
        };

        console.log(isASubsequence(sub, str));
