        /*
        Given two strings, one named sub, and the other str, determin is sub is a subsequence of str

        const str = "barbell"
        const sub = "bell"
        isASubsequence(sub, str);
        // this would return true

        so what is a subsequence? You can think of it as a substring, but the letters don't have to be adjacent. 
        It is formed by the base string by deleting some of none of the characters without affecting positions of the other letters. So this allso works

        const str = "chicken"
        const sub = "hen"
        isASubsequence(sub, str);
        // this would also return true
        
        */

        const sub = "ace";
        const str = "abcde";

        const isASubsequence = (sub, str) => {
            let i = 0;
            let j = 0;
            while (i < sub.length) {
                if (j === str.length) {
                    return false;
                }
                if (sub[i] === str[j]) {
                    i++;
                }
                j++;
            };
            return true;
        };

        console.log(isASubsequence(sub, str));
