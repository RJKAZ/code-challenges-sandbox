        /*
        We have an array of length 2 * n (even length) that consists of random integers
        [1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4]

        we are asked to create pairs out of these integers, like such

        [[1,3], [2,6], [5,4]]

        how can we divide up the pairs such that the sum of smaller integers in each pair is maximized? 

        with the example input of [3,4,2, 5] the return value should be 6 because the maximum sun of pairs is 6 = min(2,3) + min(4,5)


        so we want to get the highest possible smaller number in each pair

        the first thought is that we need to sort the numbers before we do anything else. so that we can alocate pairs with the largest possible minimum

        to get the largest possible minimum in the pair, you have to waste a larger number to accompany it. This should be the smallest possible number that is larger than the minimum in the pair.

        it seesm that after sorting the whole list, the numbers will naturally be in the order for the pairs to achive the above. 

        so with this solution we sort the numbers, then sum up the numbers at every position.

        function maxOfMinPairs(numbers) {
            let sum = 0;
            numbers = [...numbers].sort((a, b) => a - b);
            for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 2) {
                sum += numbers[i];
            }
            return sum;

        }

        console.log(maxOfMinPairs([3, 4, 2, 5]))
