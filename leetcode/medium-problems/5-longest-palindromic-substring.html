        /*
        Redquark solution 

        We are given a string and we have to find a substring which is the longest palindrome
        - A Palindrome is the one which is equal if read from left to right and from right to left - 
        for example, in the string "abbaa", palindromes are "abba", "bb", "aa"
        Our output should be abba as it is the longest. 

        Approach 

        There are many ways to solve this problem. The most common way is to treat each character of the string as the center and expand left and right.
        Keep track of their lenghts and return the string with maximum length
        So whats the problem? The problem is time complexity - it will be O(n^2) which isn't good

        Why is this hurting us, we are expanding left and right treating each character as the center. What if we only expand only at the necessary characters instead of expanding at each character
        
        Can we do that? Ye we can using Manachers Algorithm. This algorithm intelligently uses characteristis of a palindrome to solve the problem in linear O(n) time
        
        1. The left side of a palindrome is a mirror image of its right side
        2. Odd length palindromes will be centered on a letter and even length palindrome will be centered in between the two letters(thus there will be total 2n + 1 centers)

        Manachers Algorithm deals with the problem of finding the new center. Below are the steps

        1. Initialize the lengths array to the number of possible centers
        2. Set the current center to the first center
        3. Loop while the current center is valid:
            a. Expand to the left and right simultaneously until we find the largest palindrome around this center 
            b. fill in the appropriate entry in the longest palindrome lengths array
            c. Iterate through the longest palindrome lengths array backwards and fill in the corresponding values to the right of the entry for the current center untill an unknown value (as described below is encountered. 
            d. Set the new center to the index of this unknown value 
        4. Return the longest substring

        time complexity - note that at each step of the algorithm we're either incrementing our current position in the input string, or filling in an entry in the lengths array. Since the lengths array has size linear in the size of the input array, the algorithm was worst case linear O(n) running time

        space complexity - since we are using the palindrome array to store the lenght of palindromes centered at each character, the space complexity will also be O(n)
