        // given a string 's' find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
        // constraints 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
        // 's' consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces. 

        /*
        The input will be a string containing characters which may or may not be repeated. The ask is to find the longest substring (a part of a the given string) having all distinct characters
        One characteristic of a substring is that all characters are contiquous. For eg, in a given string, s = redquark, the valid substrings are - edg, ar, red, quar etc.

        The substrings rd, qur are not valid substrings because even though they contain characters from the source string, those characters are not continuous.

        apart from the above we are given constraints on the size of the string and the characters that are present in a string

        there can be many substrings as outputs but we have to return only the longest among them. 

        Approach -
        Sliding Window Algorithm
        From the input we can gather the following information -
        1. given the data structure is a string which is a linear data structure
        2. the output must be a substring - a part of the given string 
        3. native solution is to check for each combination of characters in the string

        This is the legendary Sliding Window Algorithm

        Following are the steps we will follow
        1. Have two pointers which will define the starting index start and ending index end of the current window. Both will be 0 at the beginning.
        2. Declare a "Set" that will store all the unique characters that we have encountered.
        3. Declare a variable maxLength that will keep track of the length of the longest valid substring.
        4. Scan the string from left to right one character at a time.
        5. If the character has not encountered before ie...not present in the "set" we will add it and increment the end index. the maxlength will be maximum of Set.Size() and existing maxLength.
        6. If the character has encountered before ie., present in the Set, we will increment the Start and we will remove the character at start index of the string 
        7. Steps #5 and #6 are moving the window
        8. After the loop terminates, return maxLength

        Time Complexity - We are scanniong the string from left to right only once, hence the time complexity will be O(n)
        Space Complexity - We are using 'Set' as a data structure to facilitate our computation, therefore the space complexity should also be O(n) right? wrong

        Why wrong?

        The  problem clearly states that the string only contains English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces and are covered in 256 code points. Therefore a string will be makde up of a combination of these characters.

        Since a 'Set' can contain only unique elements, at any point the size of a Set cannot be more then 256.

        What does this mean? this means that the size of a set is a function indepenedent of the size of the input. It is a constant, therefore the space complexity will be O(1)
