        /* Leet Code Problem 
        Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
        
        Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
        Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

        constraints 
        - The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]
        - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
        - Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non decreasing order
        */

        /* RedQuark Solution 
        We will be given two sorted linked lists, and we need to merge them in such a way that the resultant list will also be sorted. Lists are sorted in the non-decreasing order, therefore the resultant list should also be in non-decreasing order.

        Approach. 
        1. Check is any of the lists is emtpy
        2. First we need to determine the head of the resultant list. This head will be smaller of the heads of the given lists. 
        3. Loop through each node of the lists until one of the lists gets traversed completely. 
        4. While traversing the lists, identify smaller of the nodes of the lists and add it to the resultant list. 
        5. Once the loop is complete, there may be a case where a list has nodes remaining. We will add those remaining nodes to the resultant list

        Time Complexity 
        If the number of nides are m and n in both lists, then the overall time complexity will be O(m+n) becasue we are traversing all the nodes of both the lists. 

        Space Complexity 
        We are creating a list to store our result. But we are not using it as part of our intermediate computations. Hence the space complexity according to me will be O(1);
