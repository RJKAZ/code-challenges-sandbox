        /* Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome integer
        An integer is a Palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome, while 123 is not. 
        
        Anaylsis 
    
        We need to find if a given number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is one which when reversed gives the same number. 747 is a palindrome, where as 526 isn't since reversed it is 625
    
        Also, negative numbers are not palindrones because they start with - and when reversed the -sign will come at the end which is invalid. Therefor we only check for positive numbers.
    
        Approach 
        1. If the number is negative, return false, else proceed to #2
        2. Store the given number (x) in a variable 'number'. We are doing it becasue we will perform our operations on 'number' and due to that, its value will change. 
            We will use x at the end of the program to compare with the reversed number
        3. Reverse the number
        4. return true if the reverse number and the given number are equal, false otherwise
    
        Time Complexity
        Since we are going through the entire number digit by digit, the time complexity should be O(log10^n)
        The reason behind log10 is because we are dealing with integers which are base 10
    
        Space Complexity - We are not using any data structure for interim operations, therefore the space complexity is 0(1)

        var isPalindrome = function (x) {
            // base condition, to get rid of negative numbers
            if (x < 0) {
                return false
            }
            // store the number in a variable
            let number = x;
            // this will store the reverse of the number
            //making a reverse variable and setting it to 0
            let reverse = 0;

            while (number > 0) {
                reverse = reverse * 10 + number % 10;
                number = parseInt(number / 10);
            }
            return x === reverse;

        };

        console.log(isPalindrome(121))
        console.log(isPalindrome(123))
