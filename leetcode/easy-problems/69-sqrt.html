        /*
        Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x
        Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned
        note - you cannot use any built in exponenct function or operator. 

        example
        input: x = 4
        output: 2


        example 
        input: x = 8
        output: 2
        Explanation - the square root of 8 is 2.82842... and since the decimal part is trunicated, 2 is returned. 
        */

        Time Complexity - O(log(n))
        Space Complexity - O(1)
