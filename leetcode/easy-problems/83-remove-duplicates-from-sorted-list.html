        Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.
        Return the linked list sorted as well

        example 
        input: head = [1,1,2]
        output: [1,2]
        */

        /*solution from Medium.com

        There are two ways to think about this problem

        1. Compare each element and remove the nide with the same throughout iteration
        2. Compare each element and relink after the value are different

        var deleteDuplicates = function (head) {
            let current = head;
            // condition, we have to loop over the linked list
            while (current !== null && current.next !== null) {
                if (current.val === current.next.val) {
                    current.next = current.next.next;
                } else {
                    current = current.next;
                }
            }
            return head;
        };

// this solution works, but I couldn't get a console.log to work
