        /*
        Given an integer array 'nums', find the continous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum

        a subarray is a continguous part of an array

        contiguous means sharing a common border, touching, ot next together in sequence. 

        example

        input: nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ]
        output: 6

        Brute Force Solution from medium.com

        This is the most obvious  solution, but unfortunatly isn't very efficent. The basic idea is that you calculate the sum of every
        possible contingious subarray and play king of the hill with a max sum variable. 

        steps
        1. scan though each cell in the array
        2. intialize maxSum and set it to -Infinity 
        3. Set currSum to 0
        4. Scan through starting at current index through end of array
        5. add each index to currSum
        6. check if it is greater than maxSum, if so then assign currSum to maxSum
        7. return maxSum 
        */

        function findMaxSubArrayBruteForce(arr) {
            let maxSumBF = -Infinity;
            let currSumBF;
            for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                currSumBF = 0;
                for (var j = i; j < len; j++) {
                    currSumBF += arr[j];
                    if (maxSumBF < currSumBF) {
                        maxSumBF = currSumBF
                    }
                }
            }
            return maxSumBF;
        }

        // This solution is bad because it has a nested loop giving it a time complexity of big O(n^2) which you want to avoid at all cost
        // The space complexity is O(1) since the allocated memory doesn't grow based on the input. 

        /*

        The true key to the solution is to understand the role that negative numbers play. 

        in this example

        Input: [-2, -11, -13, -2, -14, -9, -5, -15, -3],
        output: -2
        Explanation: [-2] has the largest sum = -2

        in that example, all the numbers are negative. this means that adding two together will always be worse then just using the lower one. 

        Negative numbers can be useful for building upon a sum though 

        Input: [2, 1, -1, 4],
        Output: 6
        Explanation: [2,1,-1,4] has the largest sum = 6

        In that example, the negative number is used to bridge between the positve numbers on on side and the positive number on the other
        If we change this example slightly we can see at what point the bridge isn't useful

        Input: [2, 1, -3, 4]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: [2, 1, -3, 4] has the largest sum = 4

        The sum of the first three characters zeros out, this means that the sum for the contingious array essentially starts over. 
        Essentially the contiguous array could start over at 4 (the 3rd index) and it wouldn't matter

        with this insight, our strategy can be to start our currSum over at zero if it falls below zero

        steps we will take
        1. Initialize a currSum set to 0, and maxSum set to -Infinity - (the solution sets both to -Infinity?)
        2. Scan through each cell in the array
        3. Check if currSum is below 0
        4. If so, then assign it to 0
        5. Add the value of the current index to currSum
        6. check if currSum is greater than maxSum
        7. If so, then assign maxSum to currSum 
        8. return maxSum

        var maxSubArray = function (nums) {
            let currSum = 0; // with -Infinity, this still works
            let maxSum = -Infinity;
            for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                currSum = Math.max(0, currSum);
                currSum += nums[i];
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currSum);
            }
            return maxSum;
        }

        console.log(maxSubArray([2, 1, -1, 4]))
