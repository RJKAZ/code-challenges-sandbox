        /*
        You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-dereasing order and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and num2

        merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order

        the final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the frist m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. Nums2 has a length of n

        input: nums 1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
        output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

        Explanation: the arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6]
        the result of the merge i s [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1

        this solution from dev.to will have a space complexity of O(1)

                    nums1[m + n - 1] = ums1[--m];
                } else {
                    nums1[m + n - 1] = nums2[--n];
                }
