        Return the index of the first occurence of neddle in haystack, or -1 ifneedle is not part of haystack

        what should we return when needle is an empty string? This a great interview question
        For the purpose of this problem we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. 

        input: haystack = "hello", needle = " ll"
        output: 2

        Redquark Solution 

        This problem can be rephrased in simple words as, give two strings 'haystack' and 'needle', find if needle is present in haystack. 
        We can easily do this by using libary methods but since this is an algorithmic problem we not do so.

        We will follow the following steps
        1. Take the lenght of the needle as needleLength
        2. Scan the haystack from left to right
        3. Check is substrings of length 'needlelenght' are present in it. 

        time complexity - The string is traversed once so the time complexity will be O(n)
        Space Complexity - We may have to create n substrings of length 1 each, therefore the space copmplexity will also be O(n)

        var strStr = function (haystack, needle) {
            // Base Condition 
            if (haystack == null || needle == null) {
                return -1;
            }
            // special case
            if (haystack === needle) {
                return 0;
            }
            // length of the needle
            const needleLength = needle.length;
            // Loop throuhg the haystack and slide the window
            for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length - needleLength + 1; i++) {
                if (haystack.substring(i, i + needleLength) === needle) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
            return -1;
