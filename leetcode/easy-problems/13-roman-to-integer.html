        // ok...this one makes no sense to me, but its converting Roman numerals to integers
        // There are a few constraints -
        // 1 <= s.length <= 15
        // s contains only the characters ("I", "V", "X", "L", "C", "D", "M")
        // It is guarnteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999]
        /*
        So basicly we will be a given a number between 1 and 3999, and we will have to convert in into corresponding Roman equivilent
        Some Roman symbols and their equivalent integer values are already given. Only thing we need to notice is the cases where subtraction is used

        This problem should be very simple to solve. Since the max number is 3999, we can only have four places. - Ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands

        Thus, we will create four arrays with all the possible combination of places. Since 0 doesn't make any impact, we will put 0th place of every as an empty string 

        The four arrays will be like below     
    

        M = ["", "M", "MM", "MMM"]
        C = ["", "C", "CC", "CCC","CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM" ]
        X = ["", "X", "XX", "XXX","XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC" ]
        I = ["", "I", "II", "III","IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX" ]

        
        Lets understand this with an example num = 2467
        - Thousands place -> 2
        - Hundred place -> 4
        - Tens place -> 6
        - Ones place -> 7

        If we get the corresponding values from the arrays, then we will get M[2], C[4], X[6], and I[7]

        the output will be MMCDLXVII

        Time Complexity - We are scanning each digit of the number one by one, therefore the time complexity will be O(log10^n)

        But n cannot be greater then 3999, therefore the maxium time can be O(loh10^3999)~=0(3.60) which is constant hence the overall time complexity will be 0(1)

        Space Complexity 

        We are using four Arrays who sizes don't depend on the input size hence the space complexity will be 0(1)

            return M[Math.floor(s / 1000)] + C[Math.floor((s % 1000) / 100)] + X[Math.floor((s % 100) / 10)] + I[s % 10];

        };

        console.log(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"));


        // ok...this solution from what I can tell doens't work, and I don't understand really any of it. Pray I don't get asked this specific question.
