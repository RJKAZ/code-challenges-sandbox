        /*
        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order. 
        Remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
        The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. 

        Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, 
        You must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.
        More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, 
        then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements. 

        Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums

        Do not allocate extra space for another array. 
        You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory

        To sove this we will use the two pointer method
        the first pointer "j" is needed to iterate through the given array 
        and a second pointer (i) is needed to place a unique number to the position next to it. 

        Steps to solve this
        1. Return 0 if the given array is empty
        2. Delcare two pointers, i and j, and set them to 0 and 1 respectivly
        3. Use a while loop to check if the number with index j is equal to the number with index i
        4. If not increment i by 1 and copy the value of the number with index j to the element at the index i and then increment j by 1

        var removeDuplicates = function (nums) {

            var i = 0;
            var j = 0;
            while (j < nums.length) {
                if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {
                    i++
                    nums[i] = nums[j]
                    j++
                } else j++
            }
            return i + 1
        }

        console.log(removeDuplicates([1, 1, 2]));
