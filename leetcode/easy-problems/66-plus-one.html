        You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits. 
        Where each digit[i] is the 9th digit of the integer, the digits are ordered from most significant to least signifcant in left to right order. 
        The large integer does not contain any 0's

        Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits
        input: digits = [1,2,3]
        Output: [1, 2, 4]
        Explanation: the arry represents the integer 123. Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124
        thus the result should be [1, 2, 4]
