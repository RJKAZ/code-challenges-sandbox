        /* Offical Question
        Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings
        if there is no common prefix, return an empty string ""

        example 
        - Input - strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
        output: "fl"

        constraints 
        - 1 <= strs.length <= 200
        - 0 <= stars[i].length <= 200
        - strs[i] consists of only lower case english letters
        */

        /*
        Red Quark Solution 
        As per the question, we will be given an array of some strings which can be varying lengths, We only have to find first n characters which appear in each string between the indices 0 and n - 1.

        It is clear that the common characters cannot be more then the lemgth of the shortest string of all the given strings. Therefor, we will first find the shortest string amongst all strings and check maxium characters of it are present in all the other strings

        If not a single character is present in all the other string, we will return an empty string 

        The Approach
        1. First we will find the shortest string and its length
        2. Secondly we will take the first string and match its each character one by one with all the other strings
        3. As soon as we encounter a character which does not match we will break out of the loop

        Time Complexity
        If n is the length of the array and m is the length of the shorest string, the worst case time complexity will be O(m x n)

        Space Complexity 
        Since we are not using any internal data structure for intermediate computations, the space complexity will be O(1)

        var longestCommonPrefix = function (strs) {
            // setting the variable of longestCommonPrefix to an empty string value
            let longestCommonPrefix = " ";
            // Base condition
            // if the strs are equal to null or their length is equal to zero, we will return an empty string
            if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
                return longestCommonPrefix;
            }
            // setting a minimumLength variable and setting it equal to the length of the 0 index of the strs array 
            let minimumLength = strs[0].length;
            // looping over every iteration in the array 
            for (let i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
                minimumLength = Math.min(minimumLength, strs[i].length);
            }
            // get the current character from the first string
            //  loop for the minimun length
            for (let i = 0; i < minimumLength; i++) {
                let current = strs[0][i];
                // check if this character is found in all other strings or not
                for (let j = 0; j < strs.length; j++) {
                    if (strs[j][i] != current) {
                        return longestCommonPrefix
                    }
