        /*
        You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top
        Each time you can climb 1 or 2 steps. 
        In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top. 

        example
        Input: n = 2
        Output: 2
        Explanation - there are two ways to climb to the top
            1. 1 step + 1 step
            2. 2 steps

        Input: n = 3
        Output: 3
        Explanation - there are two ways to climb to the top
            1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
            2. 1 step + 2 steps
            3. 2 Steps + 1 step 

        
        This is a typical dynamic problem

        the first step will only have one possability
        the second step will have two possabilities

            }
