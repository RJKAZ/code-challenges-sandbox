        /*
        Given a string s consisting of some words seperated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
        a word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only

        example 1 -
        Input: s = 'Hello World'
        Output: 5
        why? The last word is "World" with a length of 5

        Solution from https://rishabh1403.com/posts/coding/leetcode/2020/03/leetcode-length-of-last-word

        We will take the following steps
        1. First we will trim the sentence, it will remove extra white spaces from both ends of the string
        2. Next we'll split the sentence by a space character which will give us a list of all the words
        3. At last, we'll check if the word list has any entries, if yes, we'll return the length of the last word

        Time Complexity 
        - we are splitting the sentecne into words which are dependent on the length of the string. So the time complexity is O(n)

        Space Complexity 
        - We are using extra space to store words in an array, thus space complexity would be O(n)

        var lengthofLastWord = function(s) {
            const words = s.trim().split(" ");
            return words.length > 0 ? words[words.length -1].length : 0;
        };

        console.log(lengthofLastWord("time to have some fun"));
