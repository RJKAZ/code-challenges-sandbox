Here is the list of JavaScript Methods - Each day I will do a deep dive into them.

1. .map() - creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array

2. .filter() - this method creates a new array with only elements that passes the condition inside the provided function

3. .sort() - this method will arrange/sort an array's elements in either ascending or descending order

4. .forEach() - this method will loop over an array by executing a provided callback function for each element in the array

5. .concat() - this method will merge two or more arrays and return a new array without changing the existing array

6. .every() - this method checks every element in the array that passes the condition, returning true or false

7. .some() - this method checks if at least one element in the array that passes the condition, return true or flase

8. .includes() - this method checks if an array includes the element that passes the condition, returning true or false

9. .join() - this method returns a new string by concatenating all of the array's element seperated by the specified seperator

10. .reduce() - this method applied a functon against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value

11. .find() - this method returns the value of the first element in an array that passes the test in a testing function

12. .findIndex() - this method returns the index of the first element in an array that passes the test in a testing function

13. .indexOf() - this method returns the index of the first occurance of the specified element in the array, or -1 if it is not found

14. .fill() - this method fills the elements in an array with a static value and returns the modified array

15. .slice() - this method returns a new array with specified start to end elements

16. .reverse() - this method reverses and array in place. Elements at last index will be first and elements at 0 index will be last

17. .push() - this method adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array

18. .pop() - this method removes the last element form the end of the array and returns that element

19. .shift() - this method removes the first element from the array and returns that element

20. .unshift() - this method adds one of more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array
