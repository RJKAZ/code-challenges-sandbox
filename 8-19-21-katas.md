A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.

He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month. Furthermore this percent of loss increases of 0.5 percent at the end of every two months. Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.

Can you help him?

How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and how much money will he have left over?

Play with two Strings

Your task is to combine two strings. But consider the rule:

Input strings a and b: For every character in string a swap the casing of every occurrence of the same character in string b. Then do the same casing swap with the inputs reversed. Return a single string consisting of the changed version of a followed by the changed version of b. A char of a is in b regardless if it's in upper or lower case - see the testcases too.
