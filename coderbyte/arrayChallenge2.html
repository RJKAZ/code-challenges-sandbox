        /*
        Have the function ArrayChallenge(arr) read the array of integers stored in arr which will be formated [K, r1, r2, r3,...]
        K represents the number of desks in a classroom. 
        The rest of the integers will be in sorted order and will represent the desks thate are already occupied. 
        All of the desks will be arranged in 2 columns, where desk 1 is at the top left, desk 2 is at the top right, desk 3 is below 1, and desk 4 is below 2, etc
        The program should return the number of ways 2 students can be seated next to each other. 
        This means 1 student is on the left and 1 student is on the right
        or the 1 student is directly above or below the other student

        so the arr of [12,2,6,7,11]

        the classroom should look like this

        1 2
        3 4
        5 6
