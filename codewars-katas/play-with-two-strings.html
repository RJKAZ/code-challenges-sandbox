        /*
        Your task is to combine two strings. But consider the rule:

        Input strings a and b: For every character in string a swap the casing of every occurrence of the same character in string b.
        Then do the same casing swap with the inputs reversed. 
        Return a single string consisting of the changed version of a followed by the changed version of b. 
        A char of a is in b regardless if it's in upper or lower case - see the testcases too.
