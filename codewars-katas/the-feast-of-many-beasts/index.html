        Animals are eating 
        1. Every animal is bringing one dish
        2. the dish must start and end with the same letters at the animals name. 
        3. So a Lion would have to bring a dish that beings with a L, and ends with a n
        4. write a function called feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false if the beast is allowed to bring the dish. 
        5. lowercase strings, at least two letters, the dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but not at the begining or end. and no numbers.
