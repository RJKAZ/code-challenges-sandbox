        Buying a car

A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.
He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month. 
Furthermore this percent of loss increases of 0.5 percent at the end of every two months. Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.
Can you help him?
How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and how much money will he have left over?

1. The old car is worth $2000, and the second hand car is worth $8000. So he needs to save up $6000 before he can sell his old car.

He can save $1000 a month, so idealy 6 months...but

the old cars price decreases 1.5 percent per month. so calculate that
take ($2000 * 1.5)* 0.01 - so the car loosses $30 the first month 



       

        console.log(2000 * 1.5 * 0.01)
        console.log(8000 * 1.5 * 0.01)

        let oldcar = 2000; 
        console.log(oldcar);

        //for (let car = 2000; car < 6; i++ ){
        //    car * 1.5 * 0.01;
        //}

        //console.log(car)


        var number = 2000;

        for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            number * 1.5 * 0.01;
            console.log(number);
        }

 // ok, all my concepts were far far off, here is the offical way to do this problem

 Car.js
function nbMonths(startPriceOld, startPriceNew, savingperMonth, percentLossByMonth) {
  //your code here
  if (startPriceOld >= startPriceNew) {
    return [0, Math.floor(startPriceOld - startPriceNew)];
  }
  
  let months = 0;
  let totalSaving = 0;
  let depreciatedPriceNew = startPriceNew;
  let depreciatedPriceOld = startPriceOld;
  let lossPercentage = percentLossByMonth; 
  while ((totalSaving + depreciatedPriceOld) < depreciatedPriceNew) {
    months += 1;
    if (months % 2 === 0) {
      lossPercentage += 0.5; 
    }
    totalSaving += savingperMonth;
    depreciatedPriceOld -= depreciatedPriceOld * (lossPercentage / 100);
    depreciatedPriceNew -= depreciatedPriceNew * (lossPercentage / 100);
  }
  return [months, Math.round(totalSaving + depreciatedPriceOld - depreciatedPriceNew)];
}
