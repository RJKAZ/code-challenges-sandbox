    <h1> You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally you would like to find out the house numbers of the people on the other side of the street</h1>
    <h2> The street looks something like this:  1| |6 3| |4 5| |2 </h2>
    <p> Evens increase on the right, odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2;</p>
